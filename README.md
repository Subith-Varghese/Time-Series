### Sales Forecasting Project using Prophet
Developed a sales forecasting model for retail stores to predict weekly sales using historical sales data.
* Data Processing: Cleaned and aggregated sales data by store and date to create time series data, ensuring accurate input for forecasting.
* Modeling: Applied the Prophet library for time series forecasting with weekly seasonality, fitting the model to store-specific historical sales data.
* Forecasting: Generated 12-week ahead forecasts for weekly sales, providing predicted values along with uncertainty intervals (yhat_lower and yhat_upper) for better decision-making.
* Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to present forecasted sales, highlighting trends and seasonal patterns for different stores.
* Key Contributions:
  * Successfully forecasted sales for individual stores, with visual representation of trends and seasonality.
  * Delivered actionable insights to enhance inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies based on forecasted sales data
