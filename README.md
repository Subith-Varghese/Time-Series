## 1.Sales Forecasting Project using Prophet :
Developed a sales forecasting model for retail stores to predict weekly sales using historical sales data.
* Data Processing: Cleaned and aggregated sales data by store and date to create time series data, ensuring accurate input for forecasting.
* Modeling: Applied the Prophet library for time series forecasting with weekly seasonality, fitting the model to store-specific historical sales data.
* Forecasting: Generated 12-week ahead forecasts for weekly sales, providing predicted values along with uncertainty intervals (yhat_lower and yhat_upper) for better decision-making.
* Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to present forecasted sales, highlighting trends and seasonal patterns for different stores.
* Key Contributions:
  * Successfully forecasted sales for individual stores, with visual representation of trends and seasonality.
  * Delivered actionable insights to enhance inventory management, staffing, and marketing strategies based on forecasted sales data
 


 ## 2.Time Series Forecasting of COVID-19 Death Cases using Prophet :
* Built a robust time-series forecasting model using Facebook's Prophet library to predict COVID-19 death cases with a 95% confidence interval.
* Processed historical data to train the model and generated forecasts for future periods, enabling informed predictions over a 14-day horizon.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis and ensured data consistency to improve model accuracy and reliability.
* Utilized confidence intervals (yhat_lower, yhat_upper) to estimate the uncertainty in forecasts, facilitating risk-aware decision-making.
* Visualized historical trends and predictions using line plots to interpret key insights, demonstrating the model's predictive power.
* Gained hands-on experience with time series forecasting, data preprocessing, and predictive analytics tools.
